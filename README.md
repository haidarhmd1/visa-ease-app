## Prerequisites

Before you start setting up the project, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

1. **Node.js:** React Native requires Node.js to run JavaScript on the server and build the application. You can download Node.js from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

2. **npm (Node Package Manager):** npm comes bundled with Node.js, so once you have Node.js installed, npm will be available automatically.

3. **Java Development Kit (JDK):** React Native requires JDK to build and run the Android version of the application. Download and install JDK from the official Oracle website: [Java SE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

4. **Android Studio:** For Android development, you'll need to install Android Studio and set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) to run the application on an Android emulator. Download Android Studio from here: [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the VisaEase React Native application:

Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/visa-ease.git
cd visa-ease
```
Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```
Step 3: Start the Metro Server

````
Step 4: Run the Application on Android or iOS

```
For iOS, use the following command:

```
Make sure you have set up the iOS development environment correctly if you intend to run the application on iOS. The React Native CLI will bundle the code and launch the application on the selected emulator or connected device.
